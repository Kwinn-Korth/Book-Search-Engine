# A-Simple-Book-Search-Engine

## Description

I changed the original code in this application to use GraphQL to query things and to work off of that because I wanted to become more familiar with GraphQL.

## Installation

You need to clone the repository to your local machine and then check the package.json file to see what you need to run, but you will definetly need to use npm install.

## Usage

Check the package.json file, you can find the commands to run depending on what you want to do with the code. You can find commands for testing queries and for running the whole thing.
